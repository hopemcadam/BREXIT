    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <h2>Y'ALL GOT ANY QUESTIONS</h2>
    <div class='main'>
      <div id="accordion">
        <h3>Will we remain a member of the Customs Union/a Customs Union?</h3>
        <div><p>The government has ruled out any customs, proposing two other options. The first is a "customs partnership", which would see the British customs authorities charge whichever is higher of British or EU tariffs on any goods entering the country, and then electronically track the progress of those goods to their destination. If the goods end up in a country with a lower tariff, the importing firm would be able to claim a refund for the difference.
    The second option is a "highly streamlined customs arrangement" which would see the UK and EU would share data and mean more businesses operating as "trusted traders". This would allow them to settle duties at regular intervals, rather than every time they moved goods across the border. The EU has dismissed the customs partnership as "magical thinking".</p></div>
        <h3>What’s the issue with the Northern Irish border?</h3>
        <div><p>There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic and both sides agree they do not want a return to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree this remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks. The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 proposes a "common regulatory area" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the "constitutional integrity" of the UK and is something no British prime minister could ever accept. Under the transitional deal Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.</p></div>
        <h3>How much will the UK have to pay to leave the EU?</h3>
        <div><p>There have been no official estimates published, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that.</p>
