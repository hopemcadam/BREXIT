    <h1>QUESTION TIME</h1>
    <div class='main'>
      <div id="accordion">
        <h3>Will we remain a member of the Customs Union/a Customs Union?</h3>
        <div><p>The government has ruled out any customs, proposing two other options. The first is a "customs partnership", which would see the British customs authorities charge whichever is higher of British or EU tariffs on any goods entering the country, and then electronically track the progress of those goods to their destination. If the goods end up in a country with a lower tariff, the importing firm would be able to claim a refund for the difference.
          The second option is a "highly streamlined customs arrangement" which would see the UK and EU would share data and mean more businesses operating as "trusted traders". This would allow them to settle duties at regular intervals, rather than every time they moved goods across the border. The EU has dismissed the customs partnership as "magical thinking".</p></div>

        <h3>What’s the issue with the Northern Irish border?</h3>
        <div><p>There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic and both sides agree they do not want a return to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree this remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks. The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 proposes a "common regulatory area" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the "constitutional integrity" of the UK and is something no British prime minister could ever accept. Under the transitional deal Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.</p></div>

        <h3>How much will the UK have to pay to leave the EU?</h3>
        <div><p>There have been no official estimates published, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that.</p></div>

        <h3>What impact will Brexit actually have on the economy?</h3>
        <div><p>Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. </p></div>

        <h3>What about British laws?</h3>
        <div><p>The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This "Great Repeal Bill", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. </p></div>

        <h3>How will be EU travel be impacted?</h3>
        <div><p>The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel. Your British passport will stay the same but the government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.</p></div>

        <h3>Will we still be able to sing in the Eurovision song contest?</h3>
        <div><p>Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.</p></div>
