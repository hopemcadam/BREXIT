          <div id="timeline-hover">
          May promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree. This vote was proposed to be a "take it or leave it" option after the deal was done. In theory, MPs could vote against and block Brexit but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement has to be ratified by Parliament.

            This is the prospect of the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal at all. That would mean having no agreement on the terms of Britain's withdrawal or future trade relations, and could lead to serious disruption to businesses and individuals.

            It also allows time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period (as the EU wanted) and the UK will be able to strike its own trade deals but they won't come into force until 1 January 2021.
